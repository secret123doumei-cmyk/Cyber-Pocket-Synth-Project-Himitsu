# Cyber-Pocket-Synth-Project-Himitsu
Cyber Pocket Synth — Project Himitsu is a touch-playable step sequencer synth built with Tone.js. Tap keys to record notes, make 16-step patterns, and shape sound with delay and reverb. Designed for late-night experimentation, it runs in the browser and works offline as a PWA — a compact atmospheric music sketchpad.
